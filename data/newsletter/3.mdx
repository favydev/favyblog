Heyya, how it’s going? Happy Sunday.

Life has been real fun last week. I’m currently in this phase when i’m in the core of building products and growing them. The initial phase of plan is over. Now comes the execution.

Here’s a thing that i realised. 

After been doing this for a month, I feel like running favy and flowcode all by myself - would be more efficient than spending my time managing a team. Although a team takes you far, what we need right now is speed. 

## Here’s why i took that decision.

Before i go further, the decision applies to me and my specific context. So doing exactly what i did, maybe wouldn’t be good for you. But You can learn from it and do what suits to you.
****
When running a team, all the people NEED to be on same page about everything. Everyone needs to know the plan. The product. The core offer. And execute in the same pace.

When all the members haven’t been together, since the day you got the idea, the amount of things you need to communicate becomes high day after day. You need to spend a lot of time to get the person ready and bring them on the same page. If their’s execution pace isn’t same as yours, It then comes to a situation where you feel like you can run this thing faster, all by yourself, than managing a team, getting into calls, assigning tasks and so on.

I’m in the same place right now. Here’s why i felt that.

Recently, we got a video editor. The experience wasn’t good. I felt like, by hiring a editor, i’m spending more time and energy than doing it myself. I had to teach him about the product. Bring him on the same page. Communicate our brand, and exactly what we want out of the video. 

It is harder than it sounds if the person is not experienced. If not on the same page, the decisions that he would make, would be different than what’s needed and i need to spend even more time with him getting that done. In that case, i’m better off doing it myself + the time that is saved.

This was the broad realisation across managing marketing and sales too.

There also comes the question of skill and competency. But you should at least do all the things, that you CAN do by yourself.

So now. i’m running this thing all by my own. Actually two. [heyfavy.com](http://heyfavy.com) and [flowcode.studio](http://flowcode.studio). I would do it until three weeks from now, and see how things went. Based on that, i’ll decide further. Currently, i’m in the 4th day of taking this decision. And it has been fairly manageable.

## Here’s how i plan to handle it forward.

To handle this, thanks to [Harlaksh](https://twitter.com/harlakshS), i divided my month into 4 week. Oh, its already done.

But next, i scheduled 1 week of building, followed by 1 week of marketing, and repeat.

This would help me to laser focus on tasks I have. And making sure eveything gets done with pace. I’ve also set up a notion Database for all the tasks I have to get done so I can focus on executing on them one by one.

When it is the build week, I focus only on building. When it is the marketing week, i focus only on marketing.

So here’s broadly what’s going on. If you have anything to say you can DM me on twitter [@yashjaing](https://twitter.com/yashjaing).

That's it. Have a great week ahead. See you next Sunday :)
