Heyya, how it’s going?

I was just going to miss out sending this newsletter, had some work to do, but i remembered i promised myself to stay consistent :)

This week was great professionally. We Made a lot of progress. We have two projects running currently. Favy and Flowcode.

In terms of [favy](https://heyfavy.com), we are done with the product development and we are ready to get beta users onboard. We could build more features and expand what we can do, but this was the perfect time for beta launch and to get feedback from real users.

We also started working on [flowcode](https://flowcode.studio). We want flowcode to be a place for beautiful template-apps, for people to clone and get 80% done with their MVP product. So they can quickly test their hypothesis and not spend time building.

While we were working on favy, it was slow, but now we are getting the wheels rolling. This week we built the website, planned for the next month, and in next 1-2 days, we will be out with our first product.

Here are few lessons I leaned last week.

> Most dangerous people in the world are not those who are ignorant to learning and ideas, they are the ones, who are ignorant but believe they are right.

Once people start believing and being so sure about what they think, they don’t let new ideas and perspective take place in their minds.

Hence, they become slate, old. They rot.

Magicians were the first neuroscientists and psychologists. They were the first to understand how people’s mind works. They do real time testing on lots of people. Magicians understands some part of your mind, that we are not aware of. That makes the illusion look real.
